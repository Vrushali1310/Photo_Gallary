This is a photo gallary application which will display photos in a collection view. On tap of specific image, that image will come in pop up where zoomed image we can see.
And on image forward and backward arrow buttons are there, on click of it we can navigate to next and back photo. If we click outside the pop up image it will switch back to original grid view.


Decisions I've made while developing this project :
1. Swift programming Language.
2. MVC pattern.
3. URLSession class for rest api communication.
4. JSONDecoder to decode api response.
5. Network layer.
6. Image Cache generic logic.
